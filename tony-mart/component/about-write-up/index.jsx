                <h3>Who we are</h3>
                <p>
                    Tony-Marts Agrofarms is a proudly African-owned
                    agricultural enterprise dedicated to producing high-quality
                    staple foods and livestock for local and regional markets.
                    Based on rich farmlands and rooted in sustainable practices,
                    we specialize in the cultivation of key African crops
                    such as cassava, maize (corn), and a variety of vegetables,
                    as well as the rearing of healthy poultry, goats, and cattle.

                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    Our goal is simple: to help feed our communities,
                    create jobs, and support food security through practical,
                    large-scale farming. From planting to harvest, and from rearing to retail,
                    we ensure every step is handled with care, quality, and purpose.

                <h3>Our core values</h3>
                <p>
                    At Tony-Marts, we believe that agriculture is more than just a
                    business—it’s a way to build a better future. That’s why we’re committed
                    to growing not just crops and animals,
                    but also opportunities for local families and aspiring farmers.
