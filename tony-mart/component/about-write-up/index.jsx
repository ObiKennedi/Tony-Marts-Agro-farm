                <h3>Who we are</h3>
                <p>
                    Tony-Marts Agrofarms is a proudly African-owned agricultural
                    enterprise with a strong focus on poultry and fishery production.
                    Located on fertile land and grounded in sustainable farming practices,
                    we are dedicated to supplying healthy, high-quality poultry, catfish,
                    and other livestock products to local and regional markets.
                    While we began with a diverse agricultural base,
                    our core operations now revolve around commercial-scale
                    poultry and fish farming, supported by a commitment to food safety,
                    quality, and community nourishment.

                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to feed communities, create employment, 
                    and enhance food security through a focused approach 
                    to poultry and aquaculture. From hatcheries to harvest, 
                    and from feed formulation to final distribution, we uphold 
                    the highest standards in every step of our production. 
                    Tony-Marts aims to be a trusted name in sustainable livestock 
                    and fishery development, helping close the protein gap in Nigeria and beyond.

                <h3>Our core values</h3>
                <p>
                    At Tony-Marts,
                    we believe agriculture—especially poultry and
                    aquaculture—is a powerful tool for transformation.
                    We’re not just raising chickens or fish; we’re raising
                    standards, building futures, and creating platforms for local families,
                    youth, and aspiring agripreneurs to thrive. Integrity, sustainability,
                    and community empowerment remain at the heart of everything we do.
